# credit-card-fraud-detection
A hands-on machine learning project that tackles the challenge of detecting fraudulent credit card transactions from a highly imbalanced dataset (0.17% fraud). This project explores multiple classification models, preprocessing techniques, and evaluation metrics to build a robust fraud detection pipeline.
