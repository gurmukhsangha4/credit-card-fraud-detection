üß† Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning
A hands-on machine learning project that tackles the challenge of detecting fraudulent credit card transactions from a highly imbalanced dataset (0.17% fraud). This project explores multiple classification models, preprocessing techniques, and evaluation metrics to build a robust fraud detection pipeline.

üîß Features
Built and compared 5 ML models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, and a Shallow Neural Network

Addressed severe class imbalance (492 frauds out of 284,807 records) using undersampling and robust scaling

Evaluated performance using Precision, Recall, and F1 Score instead of accuracy to reflect business-critical costs of false positives and false negatives

Achieved 0.90 F1 score and 95.6% test accuracy using a tuned shallow neural network on the balanced dataset

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Google Colab, Kaggle API
